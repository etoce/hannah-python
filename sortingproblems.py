# move_element_within_list()
#	Moves an element from one part of a list to another part of the list. The
#	other elements of the list should be shifted to accommodate the new
#	position of the moved element such that the list contains the same elements
#	at the end as it did in the beginning, only in different positions.
# Parameters:
#	list: The list in question
#	old_index: The index of the element to be moved
#	new_index: The index where the element is to be moved to
# Return value:
# 	The list, with the element at list[old_index] moved to new_index.
# Implementation notes:
#	-

#
# insertion_sort()
# 	Given a list, sorts it using the "insertion sort" algorithm.
# Parameters:
#	list: A list with elements comparable with the <, <=, >, >=, and == operators
# Return value:
#	A sorted version of the list.
# Implementation notes:
#	Do not use Python's built-in List.sort() or your own sorting functions.

#
# merge_sorted_lists()
# 	Given two lists that are already sorted, combine them into one list that
#	is also sorted.
# Parameters:
#	list1: A list of numbers sorted from smallest to largest
#	list2: A list of numbers sorted from smallest to largest
# Return value:
#	A list containing the elements of list1 and list2 that is also sorted from
#	smallest to largest
# Implementation notes:
#	Do not use Python's built-in List.sort() or your own sorting functions. You
#	can do this without doing a full sort of the finished list.

#
# merge_sort()
# 	Given a list, sort it using the "merge sort" algorithm.
# Parameters:
#	list: A list with elements comparable with the <, <=, >, >=, and == operators
# Return value:
#	A sorted version of the list.
# Implementation notes:
#	Do not use Python's built-in List.sort() or your own sorting functions.
#	You are encouraged to use the merge_sorted_lists() that you implemented 
#	earlier in this module.
