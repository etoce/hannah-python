#
# sum_of_dice()
#	Given a list of five integers from 1 to 6 inclusive, returns their sum
# Parameters:
#	dice: A list of five integers
# Return value:
#	The sum of the integers
# Implementation notes:
#	-
def sum_of_dice(dice):
	pass

#
# sixes()
#	Given a list of five integers from 1 to 6 inclusive, returns the sum of all
#	the sixes in the list.
# Parameters:
#	dice: A list of five integers
# Return value:
#	The sum of the sixes in the list
# Implementation notes:
#	-
def sixes(dice):
	pass

#
# three_of_a_kind()
#	Given a list of five integers from 1 to 6 inclusive, determines whether
#	there are three of the same integer in the list.
# Parameters:
#	dice: A list of five integers
# Return value:
#	True, if there is an integer that appears three or more times in the list,
#	or false otherwise.
# Implementation notes:
#	-
def three_of_a_kind(dice):
	pass

#
# full_house()
#	Given a list of five integers from 1 to 6 inclusive, determines whether
#	they can be split into one group of three and one group of two where both
#	groups consist of identical integers. For example, [5, 2, 5, 2, 5] is a
#	valid full house, as is [5, 5, 5, 2, 2]. Note that configurations where all
#	five dice are the same (e.g. [3, 3, 3, 3, 3]) are also valid full houses as
#	they can be split into a triple and a pair (e.g. [3, 3, 3] and [3, 3]).
# Parameters:
#	dice: A list of five integers
# Return value:
#	True, if the dice constitute a full house, or false otherwise
# Implementation notes:
#	-
def full_house(dice):
	pass

#
# small_straight()
#	Given a list of five integers from 1 to 6 inclusive, determines whether
#	any four of them form a straight. A group of integers form a straight if
#	and only if they are consecutive and non-overlapping. For example, 
#	[3, 4, 2, 4, 5] contains the straight [2, 3, 4, 5].
# Parameters:
#	dice: A list of five integers
# Return value:
#	True, if the dice contain a small straight, or false otherwise
# Implementation notes:
#	-
def small_straight(dice):
	pass
