# one_dimensional_wordhunt_with_wrap()
#	Determines whether a word can be found in a one-dimensional Word Hunt grid.
#	Wrapping is allowed (i.e. a word can start on one side of the grid and end
# 	on another, like how in the grid "altitude", "deal" is a valid word, as is
# 	"lae").

#	word: A string representing a possible word
# Return value:
#	True, if word can be found in grid, or false otherwise
